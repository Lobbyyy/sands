## Overview
Sands of Time is a visual life calendar that helps you understand how you spend your time. Using the average life expectancy in the UK (83.1 years), it provides a powerful visualization of your life in weeks, helping you make more mindful and intentional choices about how you spend your time.

## Why was Sands created?
We are mortal. We live and we die. That is the nature of things and we cannot change it. The only thing we can do is choose how we live and how we spend our time. Sands was built to help you live a mindful, intentional and purposeful life by better understanding how you're allocating your precious time.

## How does Sands work?
Sands of Time is a visual life calendar that helps you understand how you spend your time. Sands uses the average life expectancy in the UK (83.1 years) to calculate how many weeks you have left.

1. Enter your date of birth to see your life broken down into weeks
2. Use the checkboxes to explore how different activities fill your days. Each activity is color-coded and has a certain amount of time associated with it
3. Make the rest of your life the best of your life ❤️

## How can I use Sands to live a more mindful, intentional and purposeful life?
Knowing your time is limited can be a powerful motivator to live a more mindful, intentional and purposeful life. If we lived forever, we would have no urgency to do the things that matter. We would drift through life, doing what we are told, or what we think we should do, rather than what we want to do. Leverage Sands as a tool to help you understand how you're spending your time and make choices that align with your values and goals.
